Decision tree is a kind of machine learning method.
Decision tree is a machine learning method.
It has a tree structure in which each internal node represents a judgment on an attribute, each branch represents an output of the judgment, and finally each leaf node represents a classification result.
Decision tree is a very common classification method which is a kind of supervised learning.
Supervised learning is giving a bunch of samples, each sample has a set of attributes and a classification result, i.e., the classification result is known, then learning these samples yields a decision tree that gives the correct classification for the new data.
In the classification process, we use "entropy value" as an indicator.
The entropy value can represent the degree of confusion of a set of data.
A higher entropy value means that the set of data is more confusing, which means that it contains more different types of data.
The minimization of entropy is actually the process of improving the correct rate of classification.
